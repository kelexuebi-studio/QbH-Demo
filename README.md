# QbH-Demo

Course project of [EQ2340 Pattern Recognition](https://www.kth.se/social/course/EQ2340/) at KTH - a live demo of Query-by-Humming music retrieval system. 

The basic idea of this project comes as followed: the user queries the name of a familiar melody by humming a snippet of song to the system, and the system evaluates the probability of generating such a piece of recording for each predefined Hidden Markov Model in database and then returns the one with the maximum probability.
